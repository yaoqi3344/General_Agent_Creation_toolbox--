# AWS Bedrock APIs

Below is how you can instantiate AWS Bedrock as a provider. [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case

All feedback functions listed in the base [`LLMProvider` class](https://trulens.org/trulens_eval/api/feedback/#trulens_eval.trulens_eval.feedback.provider.base.LLMProvider) can be run with AWS Bedrock.
